/* src/index.css */
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: center;
}
Step 5: Update index.html
Make sure the script points to your entry file:

html
Copy code
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
Step 6: Test locally
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
You should see “Hello, Audioancer!” in your browser.

After this, you can build and deploy to GitHub Pages without the missing file error.

If you want, I can give you a complete ready-to-deploy Vite + React project structure for GitHub Pages, so you just copy it and it works immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
